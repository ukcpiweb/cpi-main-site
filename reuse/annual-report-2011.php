		<h2 class="reportHeader">CPI's National Industrial<br/> Biotechnology Facility</h2>
				
				<div class="columnthree"><p><strong>CPI officially launched the expansion of its state of the art National Industrial Biotechnology Facility (NIBF) in May. Minister for Universities and Science, David Willetts, was in attendance on a day which provided an opportunity for unique insight into the work of CPI and the potential of its latest facilities.</strong></p>
				
<p>The purpose of the NIBF is to stimulate the use of Industrial Biotechnology to develop and demonstrate cleaner and more sustainable manufacturing processes in the delivery of vital products. It is tailored to the production of alternative fuels and chemicals using renewable feedstocks such as biomass and waste as an alternative to traditional, chemical and finite resources. This enables the UK to evolve a cleaner, more sustainable future and accelerate its low carbon transition.</p>
</div>

<div class="columnthree"><p>The facilities available to customers of the NIBF are vast: upstream biomass processing and a new 10,000-litre fermentation capacity, together with enhanced downstream processing, adds to CPI's existing assets and offers an open access unit the scale of which is unique in the UK. It also broadens the existing pilot plant facilities found in CPI's Sustainable Processing Centre, a reconfigurable 'plug and play' capability harnessing bio, chemo and physical transformations in high value manufacturing.</p>

</p>The enhanced facility has been developed for three main applications to help develop, speed-up and improve clients' products and processes: as the next scale step up from CPI's existing NIBF capability; as a proof of concept facility for materials that will ultimately be produced at industrial scale; or as a product manufacturing facility. It will play a key role
in developing novel and sustainable
process technologies.</p>

<div class="columnthree"><p><strong>One of the key developments of the last year has been the Government's announcement that CPI will play a key role in the formation of its first elite technology innovation centre, in the area of high value manufacturing. The consortium will receive over &#163;140m of investment over the next six years to maximise the economic growth potential of new technology, building on the UK's strength in basic and applied research, in areas where substantial global markets are forecast.</strong></p>
				
<p>The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says: "This first elite technology and innovation centre in high value manufacturing will support our objective to rebalance the economy by underpinning current UK manufacturing strengths through the development and deployment of novel technologies into sectors such as aerospace, automotive and pharmaceuticals, whilst at the same time driving the UK into leading positions in new high growth markets by creating a platform for innovative SMEs to work with larger companies in developing technologies such as plastic electronics, fibre reinforced polymer composites and biotechnology." The Business Secretary, Vince Cable, says: "Each of</p>
</div>

<div class="columnthree">
<p>these partners brings with it a strong network of linkages with universities specialising in developing leading edge technologies in their areas of focus, and industrial companies seeking to co-develop and then exploit these in the market place."</p>

<p>The investment into a network of technology and innovation centres was announced by the Prime Minister in October 2010 and, as a driver of key technologies which continues to achieve tough goals and expand the horizons of innovation, was welcomed by CPI. Based on propositions by Hermann Hauser and James Dyson, the technology innovation centre model has been championed by CPI since its inception in 2004. The Government's investment into the High Value Manufacturing Technology Innovation Centre has been confirmed as in excess of &#163;140m over the next six years.</p>

<p>CPI's proven track record of work in the innovation space between the discovery of an idea and the delivery of a product or service to the commercial market clearly fits the criteria sought by the Technology Strategy Board (which was responsible for establishing and overseeing the network of centres). In technology readiness levels (TRL) CPI</p>

<p>works from level 4 to level 7. Universities typically work in level 1 to 3 and commercial businesses at level 8 and 9 - CPI and the other consortium members help bridge this gap to enable British companies to commercialise the results of world-class research in the UK and access major new high technology markets.</p>

<p>CPI Chief Executive, Nigel Perry, says: "This is fantastic news for CPI and great recognition for the CPI team and the excellent work we have done since we began in 2004. We are delighted to be part of the High Value Manufacturing Technology and Innovation Centre and the Government's initiative to grow manufacturing in the UK, and are looking forward to working with our partners in the new Centre. This announcement aids the on-going development of CPI's world class technology platforms in sustainable processing, printable electronics and high temperature processing, which enables British companies to benefit from and commercialise the results of leading research."</p>

<div class="columnequal">
<p>Ecosyl Products Limited is one of the World's leading companies involved in sales and marketing of silage additives. Based at Stokesley in North Yorkshire, it has a long tradition of research and development tracing back to its origins as part of ICI then Zeneca.</p>

<p>Ecosyl is now making use of CPI's National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator Facility for testing of its award-winning silage additive product: Ecosyl 100. It is utilising CPI's 10,000-litre fermentation capacity to run trials which will establish the viability of a continuous production run at the cutting edge facility. A successful trial will ensure that production of this globally-successful brand will remain in the UK, specifically the North East, safeguarding jobs and offering opportunities for future collaborations and innovative project development and scale-up.</p>

<p>Dr Andy Beardsmore, Ecosyl Managing Director, says: "CPI provides a readily available resource for companies such as Ecosyl, and I'm hopeful that successful testing can lead to a long term relationship between the two companies."</p>

<div class="columnequal">
<p>Global chemical and polymer company Invista is an established business relying on traditional methods which has utilised CPI's facilities to enable its entry into the industrial biotechnology sector. CPI is able to financially lower barriers to entry and de-risk process development, and has been instrumental in Invista's exploration of this field.</p>

<p>With a long-standing commitment to sustainability, Invista's step towards industrial biotechnology development is timely and, with CPI, has struck collaboration agreements whereby CPI laboratory space and expertise is exploited by the company. Over the next two years CPI's facilities and scale-up expertise will be utilised to clear Invista novel processes, enabling the company to pursue its sustainability vision: seeking innovative technologies and cost-effective ways to further improve manufacturing processes.</p>

<p>CPI's open access, fully interchangeable capability enables access to a custom molecular laboratory tailored to meet Invista's needs, and while acting as a consultancy has ongoing dialogue in the exploration of new technologies

<p>Ingenza applies state-of-the-art biotechnology approaches to obtain novel biocatalysts, engineered microbial strains and integrated chemo-enzymatic processes, resulting in more cost effective and efficient molecule manufacture in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, biotech and agrochemical industries. It works with customers and partners to implement proprietary bioprocess technologies and improve existing processes, and has been working with CPI
to develop a bench scale fermentation and downstream processing development project.</p>

<p>Heavily involved with helping develop CPI's fermentation services, Ingenza's fermentation and downstream scientists have been working closely with CPI staff to scale up and deliver a Sacchramomyces Cerevisiae yeast at 750 litre scale. Ingenza took this opportunity to allow its staff the opportunity to work in this scale of processing, taking advantage of CPI's open access set-up to help the understanding of pilot scale processes.</p>

<p>As a synthetic chemicals company, Ingenza's bench scale fermentation and downstream procecessing experience has developed its process, but CPI's expertise and unique facilities have developed this further and enabled scale-up. Following this success, CPI and Ingenza look forward to working with each other on future projects.</p>

<p>Solvert has been working with CPI in the development of a fermentation process for high value chemical production, using a particular strain of Clostridium bacteria and a food and green waste derived feedstock. Solvert's work is centered on the safe, sustainable and efficient production of n-butanol and hydrogen. n-butanol and hydrogen are considered advanced biofuels and both chemicals offer sustainable routes to a range of household products that are traditionally derived from oil, including resins, paints and cosmetics. CPI executed a tailored programme of work and facilitated Solvert's access to the laboratories and scientists at CPI. The results of the trials have proven to be very encouraging enabling Solvert to move to the next stage of the project - scaling up to 750 litre and then 10,000 litre fermentations at CPI's National Industrial Biotechnology Facility.</p>

<p>Solvert CEO, Kris Wadrop, says: "Having access to CPI's biotechnology facilities and experienced technical staff has enabled Solvert to execute the first phase of our business plan for a fraction of the cost and in less than half the time it would have taken had we decided to establish our own in-house capability. "Working, in effect as our in-house technical team, CPI has executed Solvert's Phase 1 technical programme in a professional and comprehensive manner, enabling us to achieve our technical objectives on schedule and ahead of budget. The CPI technical team also contributed to the development of the technical programme offering alternatives to the original proposal which enhanced Solvert's overall value proposition"</p>
